# Notes on Deep Generative Models

These notes form a concise introductory course on deep generative models. They are based on Stanford [CS236](https://deepgenerativemodels.github.io/), taught by [Aditya Grover](http://aditya-grover.github.io/) and [Stefano Ermon](http://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/), and have been written by [Aditya Grover](http://aditya-grover.github.io/), with the [help](https://github.com/deepgenerativemodels/notes/commits/master) of many students and course staff.

The compiled version is available [here](https://deepgenerativemodels.github.io/notes/).
